You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
1. HTML Syntax and some useful html tags such as <figure>, <figcapture>, <strike> (not the best practice?) and <sup>. <b> and <strong> are not working in Chrome for some reason. (inherit somewhere in browser?)
2. Semantic tags.
3. To remember every tag name and its meaning.
4. Google, practice and take notes.
